This is code that I programmed with one of my classmated for my SE2 class during the fall of 2020.

The application serves the purpose of acting as a scheduling application for professors scheduling jobs at a university.

Professors will log into the application using a predetermined log-in created by the server, and once they are in it will show dynamically changing data from the database that holds the informtaion. Each unique block on the home screen holds information specific to each meeting that was populated from the database such as start and end date, time, and a google maps widgit that updates based on the location.
